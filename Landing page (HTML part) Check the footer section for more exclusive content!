                        <h2>Today is "National Cotton Candy Day"

                        </h2>
                        <p>Cotton candy, or fairy floss, originated at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis. Created by William Morrison and John C. Wharton, it's essentially spun sugar with vibrant colors. The magical process involves heating a sugar mixture and spinning it through tiny holes, resulting in the fluffy treat we know today. Despite its appearance, cotton candy is almost pure sugar, delighting people with its airy texture and sweet charm at carnivals and events worldwide. </p>
